# UR3e Mockup

This folder contains the mockup implementation of the UR3e robot used in the Digital Twin case study. The mockup simulates the behavior of the UR3e robotic arm and communicates via RabbitMQ to allow interaction with digital twin components. You will find 3 different mockups which are compiled for windows, linux and macOS. When running the mockup (see [Getting Started](../examples/0_running_the_mockup.ipynb)), the appropriate binary for your operating system will be selected automatically.

In the examples folder, you will find Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to run and interact with the UR3e mockup. These notebooks cover topics such as sending control commands, receiving state updates, and configuring the mockup for different scenarios.
