    "## 1. Understanding DH Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention allows us to describe the geometry of a robot arm by defining four parameters for each link. Since the joint angle ($\\theta$) is usually the variable that changes as the robot moves, we define the robot's physical structure using the remaining three constant parameters. The DH parameters can be a bit tricky to grasp a first, and it's not necessary to have a deep understanding of them to use the Robotics Toolbox effectively. However, having a basic idea can be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`d` (Link Offset)**:  \n",
    "   *Ideally, how \"tall\" or \"deep\" is the connection along the joint axis?* \n",
    "   This is the distance measured along the joint's rotation axis (Z-axis). For a vertical joint, this is often the height of the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`a` (Link Length)**:  \n",
    "   *How long is the arm segment?* \n",
    "   This is the shortest distance between the current joint axis and the next one. It is measured along the common normal (X-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`alpha` (Link Twist)**:  \n",
    "   *Does the next joint rotate in a different orientation?* \n",
    "   This is the angle between the current joint axis and the next one. For example, if one joint rotates horizontally and the next vertically, the twist is likely 90 degrees ($\\pi/2$ radians).\n",
